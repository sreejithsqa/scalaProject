I have started data analysing from Poi List and found that the coordinate provided in the Poi List are
Calgary(Poi1 and Poi2),Montreal (Poi 3) and NovaScotia(Poi 4).Since the dataSample have duplicate data ,
I used drop duplicate method in Latitude ,Longitude and Timeset to remove duplicate rows.
The orginal length of Data Sample provided was 22025 and found out that after removing the duplicate data
it is reduced to 19999. Then next step i tried to find out the minimum distance from the Data Sample Latitude
and Longitude with Poi List Latitude and Longitude.After Calculating the Shortest Distance , i have used an List
Buffer to store the distance.Then I have converted the List buffer to a Data Frame and added an index to join the
Distance List to the data frame. By Using the group By method in scala i have tried to figure out the min distance
and corresponding Poi Location that has minimum distance to the request Location.

For finding the average of distance between the POI location to each of its assigned requests I have used the aggregate
function to find out the average of min(Distance) and for finding the Standard Deviation I have used the Describe method
in scala.And Also i have used the group by and aggregate method to find the Radius and Density.

For Data Visualization I have used the scalafx Scatter chart.Since all the shapes in scala by default is displaying in
pixel rate i came up with multi series in scatter chart with Series 1 corresponding to the geo location from Data sample
from the final result , Series 2 - Poi List Geo Location 1 and 2 (both are same value) ,Series 3 - Poi List Geo Location
3 and Series 4 - Poi List Geo Location 4. In order to customize the shape,size,color of data in each series of chart
I have used the Css Stylesheet method in scala.By filtering out the word count Poi id(eg: POI1)from final result and also
from the chart it is clear that the Poi Geo Location 3 has the most number of request received and and Geo
location 1 & 2 having second largest request received and Geo Location 4 has the lesser number of request received. Since most
of the other data row is string i couldn't able to dig deeper into it.
